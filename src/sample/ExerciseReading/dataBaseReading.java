            "\n" +
            "The psychologist Carl Jung believed that collecting is part of our ancient human history. Thousands of years ago, humans collected nuts and berries. They kept them carefully and ate them when there was no food. The best collectors survived long cold winters or seasons without rain. Their genes passed to future generations. Nowadays, we still have a collecting instinct.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Historian Philipp Bloom has a different opinion. He thinks collectors want to make something that will remain after their death. By bringing many similar items together, the collector gains historical importance. Sometimes their collections become museums or libraries, for example, Henry Huntington, who founded a library in Los Angeles to house his collection of books.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Author Steve Roach thinks that people collect things to remember their childhood. Many children collect things, but few have enough money to buy the things they really want, and they lose interest. In later life, they remember their collections fondly. Now, they have enough money and opportunity to find special items, and they start collecting again. This way, they can re-live and enjoy their childhood years.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Art collector, Werner Muensterberger, agrees that collecting is linked to childhood. But he believes we collect in order to feel safe and secure. While babies hold blankets or toys to feel safe when their mother isn’t there, adults collect things to stop feeling lonely or anxious.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Autograph collector Mark Baker agrees that collecting is emotional, but he doesn’t collect to reduce anxiety. “For me, it’s the excitement,” he says. “I love trying to get a famous person’s autograph. Sometimes I succeed, and sometimes I fail. Also, by collecting autographs, I feel connected to famous people. I don’t just watch them on television. I actually meet them.”\n" +
            "\n" +
            "These are just a few reasons for collecting. Do you know any people with collections? Why do they collect?",
            "My name is Mike, and I was born in a very poor neighbourhood in Los Angeles. When I was little, my mother took care of my brother and me, because my father left before I came to this world, and he wasn’t too interested in being a part of our lives. My mother had to work two jobs that didn’t pay much. She had to work very hard so that we could have food, clothes, and a place to live. She was great; we loved her and appreciated her efforts.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Every day, she usually arrived home very late, and she was exhausted. Still, she always cooked nice meals for us, played with us, and made sure that we did our homework. She always insisted on how important it was to get a good education. She couldn’t finish school because she got pregnant with me when she was just a teenager. “I couldn’t finish school, and that’s why I must work so hard now, and I earn so little money,” she often said.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Children were very violent in my neighbourhood; you needed to be violent if you wanted to survive. There were lots of crime, vandalism, and drugs. It wasn’t easy to be a good student for any child who lived in our neighbourhood. The other children hated you if you got good grades, so I wasn’t very popular. The only positive thing about living in that place is that you needed to be very clever to survive, and that helped me later in life.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Finally, my brother and I could finish high school. I went to university because I was a very good basketball player, and basketball paid for my university degree. On the day of my graduation, my mother was in tears. And she was in tears again the day I showed her our new apartment, away from the neighbourhood. Do you know how difficult it is to get out of a poor neighbourhood? It’s very hard, but I did it, and it was thanks to my mum. Now she doesn’t have to work two jobs anymore, and I take care of her.",

                    "Egyptian archaeologists announced on Wednesday that they have identified a mummy discovered in 1903 as that of Queen Hatshepsut (hat-shep-soot), Egypt’s most powerful female pharaoh. The mummy was originally found in the Valley of the Kings, a sacred burial site for kings and powerful nobles located on the west bank of the Nile River in Egypt. Although the mummy was discovered more than a century ago, it remained in a tomb until this past spring, when it was brought to the Cairo Museum for testing.\n" +

                    "\n" +
                    "Queen Hatshepsut was the only woman to rule ancient Egypt while the kingdom was at the height of its wealth and power, from about 1502 to 1482 B.C. Of all the female pharaohs–including Cleopatra and Nefertiti–Hatshepsut’s reign was the longest and most successful. While in power, she established trade routes and built hundreds of monuments and temples throughout Egypt. Despite her prosperous reign, both her mummy and her legacy were virtually erased from Egyptian history. Many historians believe that Tuthmose III, Hatshepsut’s stepson, destroyed records and monuments bearing her name. It may have been his revenge. It is believed that she stole the throne from him. Finding the mummy of this powerful queen may provide details about an important part of Egyptian history.",
                    "Romeo the frog spent ten years alone in a museum in Bolivia. He is a Sehuencas frog, and for a long time, scientists at the museum thought that Romeo was the only Sehuencas frog in the world. A lot of these frogs have died because of deforestation,and a deadly disease has taken the lives of many others. The scientists wanted to find a mate for Romeo. They even set up a profile for him on Match.com!\n" +
                            "\n" +
                            "In 2018, some scientists went to the Bolivian forests to look for a partner for Romeo. They looked in many streams, but they couldn’t find any frogs. They grew tired, wet and disappointed. They decided to check one more stream before going home. And then, they found a Sehuencas frog beside a waterfall. This frog was male, but they returned the next day and found four more frogs, two male and two female. One of the females was the right age to mate. The conservationists called her Juliet.\n" +
                            "\n" +
                            "The scientists didn’t let Romeo and Juliet meet at first. They needed to check that Juliet didn’t have a disease. But finally, they put the two frogs together. At first, Romeo seemed nervous, but soon he swam to Juliet and then he did a funny dance, shaking his toes. Then he put his arms and legs around her and made a really loud call.\n" +
                            "\n" +
                            "Juliet hasn’t laid any eggs yet, but scientists hope she will. That way, they can learn more about these frogs and help to protect them in the forest. But they know it won’t be easy. For frogs to mate, the temperature and the water quality must be perfect. They also only mate when it is raining, so the scientists had to put special rain equipment in their tank. However, the scientists aren’t too worried if Romeo and Juliet don’t mate, because they have the four other frogs. And they are happy that Romeo isn’t lonely any more!",
            "In Chandigarh, a city in northeast India, there is an amazing garden. There are tall rocks and small paths between them. There are waterfalls, pools, and hundreds of sculptures. The sculptures are surprising because they are all made from rubbish, like plastic jewellery, bottles, broken pots, sinks, toilets, and pieces of electrical equipment.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The garden has a surprising history too because it was built in secret! A man called Nek Chand started building the garden in 1957. He chose some land in a forest near the city, where there were rocks and a river. Nobody was allowed to build here, so Nek knew that people wouldn’t see him there. Then he started to collect rubbish and make the sculptures.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Nek’s project was illegal, but for 18 years, nobody found it. However, in 1975, some government officials discovered it. By that time, the garden was nearly 49,000m2 in size. The government tried to destroy the garden, but when the people in the city heard about it, they wanted to keep it.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "In 1976 it became a public park. After that, Nek Chand received a salary so that he could work in the garden full-time, and fifty more people were employed to work there with him. People paid to visit the garden. Nek put collection centres around the town so that he could make more recycled sculptures.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "However, the garden wasn’t safe yet. In 1990, the local government tried to build a road through the park, just for VIPs. But local people protested, and their plan failed. Later, Nek became famous. He travelled to the USA to tell people about his garden. But when he returned, his garden was destroyed! It took a long time to rebuild it and keep it safe.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Now, a charity manages the garden. Five thousand visitors visit this special place each day. Volunteers, workers, and local children still work here. They keep the garden clean and learn to make sculptures. If you like, you can volunteer here too!",
            "Residents of a small Welsh-speaking community have clubbed together to buy the post office and shop, ten years after buying the pub.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The people of Llithfaen, Caernarfonshire were determined to prevent their village losing its focal point. Ten years ago they paid £40,000 for the pub, called the Victoria, and now they have helped to keep the shop open. Most of the cost, £19,500, was met by the local council and a European Union grant, but the villagers needed to raise a further £6,000 to buy the shop from the owner who is retiring.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "John Jones, chairman of the community committee, said: “We went around every house and came back with £500 more than we needed. The post office and the pub are essential to the life of the village. There are no other amenities.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "“We were not prepared to stand by and let the heart and soul be ripped out of our community. No one else was going to help us so we decided to buy them ourselves.” Llithfaen had a population of 600 but that halved when nearby granite quarries were closed. The primary school was shut because of the population decline but the locals turned it into a leisure centre and youth club.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The shop has been leased to Ffion Medi Llywelyn, 24, who lives in the village with her husband, Dillon. She said: “There is a wonderful community spirit here.”"
